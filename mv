mv (short for move) is a Unix command that moves one or more files or directories from one place to another. Since it can "move" files from one filename to another, it is also used to rename files. Using mv requires the user to have write permission for the directories the file will move between. This is because mv changes the file's location by editing the file list of each directory. When using mv command the new file's timestamp is not updated.
